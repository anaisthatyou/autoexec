# autoexec.cfg

autoexec.cfg for [Counter-Strike: Global Offensive](http://counter-strike.net).

#### Installation

Place `autoexec.cfg` and `aliases.cfg` in your `...\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg` folder. Too load a crosshair add `exec <crosshair-filename>` to the `autoexec.cfg` file.

Example crosshairs can be found in the crosshairs folder.

You can manually run the autoexec by running the command: `exec autoexec` in the csgo console window.

An easier way to ensure it runs on startup is too add `+exec autoexec` to you launch options in the steam game settings.
